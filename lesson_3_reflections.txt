When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Using a remote repository is useful for collaborative projects with multiple
users working on changes separately and remotely. The remote repository will
allow users to sync with the master repository to update files without losing
progress on any edits in the local folder.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically makes updates to the remote repository, it could
overwrite edits that were made locally but not yet pushed to the remote
repository.
