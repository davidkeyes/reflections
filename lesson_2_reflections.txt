What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing the repository enables tracking with Git. Without this step, there
will be no record of the changes made to files in the given directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle ground for changes that exist in the directory but
have not been committed to the repository. This provides a place for changes to
exist apart from other changes, allowing to pick which changes will be part of
a given commit without deleting any other progress.
